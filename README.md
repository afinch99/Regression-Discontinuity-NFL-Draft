# Regression-Discontinuity-NFL-Draft

I use a sharp Regression Discontinuity design to estimate the causal impact that the round in which an athlete is selected in the National Football League (NFL) draft has on career longevity and other outcomes. Rational Choice Theory suggests that behavior should not be influenced by sunk cost. This implies that coaches in the NFL should ignore where a player was selected in the draft when deciding which athletes to sign and play.  I find no discontinuities in career longevity between athletes selected on either side of the thresholds, indicating that NFL coaches and teams are acting rationally in roster construction and playing time decisions.

Files in this Repository include: 

1. FinalDataStandardized.csv -- The complete dataset used for this project, including all NFL draft picks from 1994 - 2022 and outcome variables relating to career longevity and achievement. This dataset was compiled using several sources as described in the research paper.
2. RD_code.do -- Regression Discontinuity experimentation and visualization through STATA
3. WriteUp.docx -- Detailed paper describing background, methodology, experimentation, results, and limitations.
